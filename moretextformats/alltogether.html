        The <mark>young man</mark> pulled the arm of the old man, and together they made it through the dark wood,
        in the direction of the scream, to a small log cabin at the shore of a black lake.
        </p>
        <P><blockquote>
        The <i>door</i> to the cabin was open, warm yellow light streaming out. Two young women were in the doorway,
        a blonde standing just inside the cabin, a dark-haired one with both feet outside, leaning forward,
        straining, but being held back by the blonde woman’s grip around her waist.</blockquote>
        </P>
        <P>
        Other than the hair color, <ins>the two looked so similar that the young man thought they must be sisters</ins>.
        <q>What’s the use,</q> the dark-haired sister said. <q>I can’t take this anymore.</q></P>
        <P>
        With that, she managed to <b>break</b> free from her sister’s grip and ran directly toward the black lake behind the cabin.</P>
        <p>
        When she got to the shore of the lake, without hesitation she threw herself forward into the water,
        and the lake swallowed her up without even a ripple marring the still,<del> black surface.</del></p>
        <p>
        The remaining sister’s shoulders slumped.</p>
